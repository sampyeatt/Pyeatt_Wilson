## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is the project page for John Pyeatt and Alexander Wilson
We designed a website that helps people who enjoy puzzles keep track of their puzzles.
It also gives people a community to share and enjoy their hobby in.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sampyeatt/Pyeatt_Wilson/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
